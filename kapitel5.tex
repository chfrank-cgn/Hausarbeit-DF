There are two ways to enable mTLS for an application. One is refactoring the application and including mutual encryption in all API calls. The other is to use a Service Mesh, such as LinkerD or Istio, to encrypt the intra- and inter-application traffic.

In this paper, we use a sample application with Istio and Linkerd and find that both provide the desired functionality and can add mTLS to an existing application. LinkerD uses less overhead than Istio.

Other service meshes are available, including the Cilium service mesh.\footnote{\textit{Cilium (2025)}: Cilium Service Mesh. \cite{ciliumMesh}}

If you need to encrypt application traffic, using a Service-Mesh is a viable alternative to refactoring your code.

Happy Ranching!
